Goals:
** Use this bootstrap's login.html with the secure login/blog's acct registration and user login code
** Maintain sessions and user pages as utilized in the secure login/blog's code
** Separate PHP from HTML pages ("separation of concerns")
    NOTE: May be a bit above what I can do. Try anyways.

Prerequisites:
** Identify data that can be collected, stored in a DB, and used in the graphs/charts from the dashboard on 'index.html'
